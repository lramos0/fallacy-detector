This event did take place whether the Chinese government acknowledges it or not.', \"Many people value their culture and their languages.

We need to keep our attention on him and his family.', 'We all have seen situations like the one you speak of. Your friends do not represent the entire country or the majority of people in Hong Kong though. Perhaps they have it good so why would they not say they love the Chinese government. We cannot conclude things based on a small example of people. I am sure there are some who love the Chinese government, but they are not the only voice in that country.

I'm not sure how far they have to go, but it seems like there are some things that need to be addressed. Every political candidate should have their background apparently inspected. This could lead to a more trustworthy political process for those countries.\", 'This is troubling and tragic. Everyone knows that the financial boom of Hong Kong is due to the lack of constraint (economic freedom!). But what has worked so well for markets is not being allowed to benefit the actual people who live and work there. More freedom, always more freedom, is the way to solve problems, not repression and crackdowns! Stay strong, Hong Kong: your struggle reminds us all of the value of freedom.', 'The baker shaped loaves to resemble turtles as part of a local fair.', 'I think this is very good sign that they are withdrawing the bill and having debate on it.  It prevents a slippery slope that leads to less freedom of speech.  It is good sign that they can debate it even during such a once in a lifetime event like COVID which can increase the support of otherwise very restrictive measure against freedom. The slope can get very slippery and once it starts it is hard to go back.', 'It seems that their narrative is working for outside observers as well. You stated 202 lost but it is very likely the number was in the thousands. It is important that the push for truth and transparency continues.', \"I believe that your comment may be misguided. While you think that fake threats always lead to actual violence that is not always the case. Just because you believe in the past this has always been the case, doesn't mean this will be true for all time.  Cannot you recall other instances from the past where different actions were chosen then which would not be now? People do change and so do their actions and I'm sure with enough thought you would see that as well.\", 'I agree that music has been important for many cultural changes through history.

We are talking about the Chinese government. Of course they could do more since they had information they were more than likely trying t suppress from the world about this virus and what it would do to a city. They could have used that information to begin to mobilize the equipment they would need in order to better support the residents of Wuhan once they knew they would quarantine and shit down the city. We all should stand with Wuhan and its residents at this moment. They have been let down by their government, and that saddens me.\", 'A group of volunteers planted native wildflowers along the riverbank.', 'Reinvesting in public transit systems can address urban sprawl and improve air quality.', \"Well, isn't the statement of the article pretty obvious?

Hopefully a fair resolution will be reached.\", 'The rate of death from celebratory gunfire is so low that little attention should be done. There are much worse things going on in the country. Poverty and homelessness are bigger issues.', \"I think poverty and basic human rights can both be addressed. Poverty is often a sign of uneducated citizens, as is discrimination.

Does it even matter if it feels natural or not? I would imagine a lot of horrible things seem natural to a mentally unwell person. Does that make them okay?

We also must do more to educate people on how to behave around them and ensure neither party ends up injured. While I agree with you on that aspect, I don't agree with you that this issue is sure to lead the greater ecosystem to collapse. Fear mongering is not necessary and will likely turn people away from the issue completely. All people need to understand is how integral they are to controlling major pests, do you know anyone who likes rodent invasions? I have yet to meet the person who does and this is a key element to winning support for protecting all snake species.

People working together to get past differences is what will bring solutions to the problems you mentioned. Turning a blind eye to the events of the past only drive a larger wedge between the people that were harmed and the damage done by the terrible actions of the Indonesians that perpetrated them. It could lead to the events being repeated, which would be an even greater tragedy.

I think you are jumping to a conclusion without weighing all the facts and understanding that laws can be complex and their outcomes evolve over time. I understand the initial concern but we have to look at these issues with a discerning eye to see what the actual effects and their causes are.  At this point we are not sure if the concerns to this law will not be addressed and improve the law in the long run. I really hope that in the end all these concerns will actually lead to a more free Hong Kong and the people who live there.', 'It is great that no real information appears to have been stolen.

If it was pollution changing things, it would be more wide spread and in different areas. A possible cause to this could just be inbreeding. We're talking a few snakes, not even a few hundred.

Terrorism is rarely simply the result of one thing such as religion.  Even those who commit terrorist acts in the name of religion are misguided individuals, and in some cases, religion is used as a tool to groom or coerce these individuals to commit terrible acts.

We should always be vigilant and protect our freedoms as  much as possible, but we don't need to cause an undue amount of concern either. That level of balance is important so we do not go too far or become too complacent.

I don't know that alternative medicines would have been an effective option to address the outbreak either, but the government could have taken some measures that both addressed the potential seriousness of the virus while also respecting the basic rights and dignity of its citizens. Expanding health care options temporarily, making masks more readily available, and encouraging people who were feeling sick to limit their activity to staying home or seek medical care would have been a potential alternative way to deal with the crisis in a less brutal manner. This was a truly difficult time and the government had to make difficult decisions without a whole lot of time to think through the ramifications, but positive and direct communication with people in the city as well as neighboring areas would have cut down on anxiety and panic feelings, helping to improve things.

It is obvious that Japan's justice system needs significant reform but he wasn't Robin Hood. He committed serious crimes and needs to face the consequences. His position as a 'corporate titan' does not excuse his actions nor allow him to get away with what he has done.  Taking advantage of Japan's two-tiered justice system doesn't show any sort of superiority or 'right' - it's just another crime he needs to answer for.\", \"This might look like a slippery slope argument, but I agree with it and I think it's more like a warning.

It's a disturbing trend and people need to be aware of the threats posed by these sorts of modern populists.\", \"Most countries don't have infighting quite so extreme.   This speaks to a lack of a tradition of peaceful transition of power.   Such traditions are necessary for a healthy political system.   It's unfair to these people,  they want stability and peaceful progress,   The negative precedent this sets is terrible.  Sometimes should be done about it before the problem spreads to other regions.\", 'That\\'s part of the point I think. It seems that only one side seems to think it is okay to vote along racial lines, just like in the US. African Americans are said to be \"supportive of their race\" when they vote for candidates that are the same race that they are, but if whites vote for white people then they are seen as \"racist\". I think it is a bit more than just \"voting for someone that is of the same race I am because they know what I go through\" I think if more people were in fact color blind as you said, it would be better, but I think there is a lot of outside forces that make it seem like it is a both sides type issue. That is what seems to be happening here there is one side that is only supported by their own racial similars and a backlash of non-similars instead of looking at policies that would benefit everyone. Hopefully Macedonians and people all over the world can start looking at inclusivity as a norm that all people take part in instead of forcing it from whichever race or creed happens to have a majority in the country. Only then can a democracy flourish.', 'Why exactly are they the ones that need to be experimented on if they want vaccines for their people?

There are definitely more than just two approaches to help fix the police force in the Philippines. Clear and comprehensive training for police officers would be the obvious first step, followed by a ongoing program that monitors any violations as they occur.

It's hard to believe that Jacobson knows what he is talking about when he claims such a thing that can easily be proven wrong. Comparing both conclusions, you really don't know what to believe.

I don't know that alternative medicines would have been an effective option to address the outbreak either, but the government could have taken some measures that both addressed the potential seriousness of the virus while also respecting the basic rights and dignity of its citizens. Expanding health care options temporarily, making masks more readily available, and encouraging people who were feeling sick to limit their activity to staying home or seek medical care would have been a potential alternative way to deal with the crisis in a less brutal manner. This was a truly difficult time and the government had to make difficult decisions without a whole lot of time to think through the ramifications, but positive and direct communication with people in the city as well as neighboring areas would have cut down on anxiety and panic feelings, helping to improve things.

The people of Malaysia need to make sure their government doesn't get away with any kind of censorship or they will just keep doing it.

While it's terrible for people to die from poverty and starvation in Cameroon, it's equally terrible for people's freedoms to be repressed and journalists and others arrested and killed for it. We can focus on both at the same time. Journalists like Lambert Kehven, Samuel Wazizi, and Kingsley Fomunyuy are courageous individuals who brought truth to light, and we should support them in the fight for their cause.

You're trying to make a slippery-slope argument, as if someone's going to take away all guns. But we can take safety measures and still keep our civil liberties. Los Angeles warns of criminal charges with jail time to deter the practice, so it's possible to respect responsible gun ownership and curb reckless behavior.\", 'I dropped my phone and it landed screen-side down.', 'There’s a great movie playing at the cinema nearby.', 'Governments and law enforcement agencies need to step up and protect women across the globe but especially in the more middle eastern societies.

I'm sure the people are strong enough to get through it. Maybe maybe covid quarantine will be successful.\", 'This is very concerning. I hope the activists can make some headway, and perhaps the international community can pressure the military leadership in Myanmar to repeal the bill and give more thought to the importance of basic human freedoms. If we are united in our opposition to this kind of crackdown, perhaps we can effect change not only in Myanmar but around the world.', 'Moral standards must be clearly defined in society to increase harmony among transcendental groups of a country. Ethical standards are formulated in intrinsic valuations contrasted against moral beliefs that are transcendent. Everyday people are that of a transcendent type and base their everyday modalities on such belief systems. Belief systems are formulated through out centuries simply know as the culture of a people. Deep rooted traditional values are signs and guidelines that maintain a natural order of harmony for the over all totality as universal knowledge and style. This is the vitalism that maintains a viability mode of existence for the populace of a territory. However if such transcendental values are held to tightly a stagnation will occur and the populace will begin to experience strife and violence. Open set of moral values must be accommodated for change to allow for what one might define as metabolism or a respiratory system that allows the culture to digest or breath new life in succession.  Impulse and extreme reflexivity with an excluded middle, meaning, catering to a virtual instead of an actuality of life is a doom loop in the making. The golden ratio must be found.', 'These threats are so horrific, even if no real bombs were present.  This kind of thing makes people scared all the time.  Being in constant fear is no way to live, and these people deserve better.  Hopefully, the people responsible will be held accountable at some point.  I hope the innocent citizens can feel safe again soon.', \"North Macedonia's challenging past makes for a troubling present. The ethnic and religious divisions that shattered Yugoslavia into pieces like Macedonia seem to linger. It's a place where a war criminal can become an MP and where ethnic nationalism is part of party's platform. What the country needs is unity among the different religious and ethnic groups, and political stability. This is accomplished easier with the Social Democrat candidate, but the country still has a way to go before it is fully unified. Stay strong, Macedonia.\", \"Its very sad that that China and its weak response to the pandemic has led the people of Wuhan down by not  giving them the appropriate medical and food supplies necessary to combat this disease. Fudging the numbers or ignoring the problem doesn't make it go away and to shutdown an entire city because of the pandemic it just makes the situation worse. Access to resources like medical treatments to those that need it the most is the appropriate action as oppose to shutting everything down.\", 'The evidence shows that stricter gun laws reduce gun violence.', \"There's no justification for his escape; by doing so, it makes his guilt more apparent.  It is obvious that Japan's justice system needs significant reform but he wasn't Robin Hood. He committed serious crimes and needs to face the consequences. His position as a 'corporate titan' does not excuse his actions nor allow him to get away with what he has done.  Taking advantage of Japan's two-tiered justice system doesn't show any sort of superiority or 'right' - it's just another crime he needs to answer for.\", 'Why exactly are they the ones that need to be experimented on if they want vaccines for their people? Africans should get tested on so that Africans, Europeans, and Americans get vaccines? Why not conduct these fairly risky trials on Americans and then all those groups could get vaccines? The disparity in treatment is the whole point of the article.', \"The government should have no control over the media. If the government could be trusted that would be a different story but governments across the globe have proven time and again that they can't be so we need to have many opinions and freedom of press. A free and diverse media allows for a informed public and keeps everyone free.\", 'She wrote a note on the back of an envelope.', 'I agree with you. Seems that there must be more going on then what we know about otherwise it really makes no sense that they are getting involved in yet another hot situation. I think they feel they can get involved in whatever they want due to the fact they are nuclear armed.', 'its a terrible situation and i think even more terrible is the fact that the country that did this does not bear any responsibility or blame when it comes to it. its just sad and a terrible situation. i feel bad for the people', 'She watered the plants while humming a tune.', 'What evidence has been offered?

I didn't realize how deep the Shiite/Sunni divide really goes in terms of violent antipathy within Afghanistan.\", \"I agree that the actual abuses going on in Myanmar are frightening and need to be addressed, however that doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about them shutting off the internet to their citizens. In fact having internet access will only help raise awareness and let us understand what actual abuses are going on. If we allow the silence of the victims of this coup then we will never know the truth of what is actually happening, that is simply not acceptable. I feel that we can and must face both of these problems at the same time, anything else is just dangerous.  I certainly hope that the United Nations will step up here, way too little going on in terms of actual results.\", \"Saying they have racial bias loses a bit of nuance. Just like in the developed countries like America, people who come from a certain group understand and care about the issues relating to that group more than people outside of it. Macedonians voting for a Macedonian who they feel represents them well is no different from African Americans voting for African American candidates. Of course it would be ideal if the entire world were colorblind, but that's not the real world and people have to look out for their own interests in what ways they can.\", 'so much attention is drawn when there is an allegation or accusation. this makes it hard because it brings so much attention and provides an easy out for someone to falsely accuse someone. there should be harsh penalties for women who make false allegations for one reason or the other.', 'The leaves changed colors as autumn approached.', \"There's always some kind of conflict over there in the middle east. How don't they get tired of the constant fighting? I pray for the people who just want to live peacefully.

Maybe other uses of these laws are bad, but I somehow doubt the football organizations are going to do anything but block illegal broadcasts, like they claim. And should they not? The concept of needing a court order to block a live stream on a time-sensitive sports match doesn't seem sensible.\", 'The students should have been allowed to peacefully protest.
